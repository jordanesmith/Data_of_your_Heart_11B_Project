find out what preprocessing they did in NNN approach

produce slide with summary of details:
	input data
	output
	preprocessing 
	train/test 

test their model on the train dataset to check it works

maybe augment/ modify training data so its not identical to training data for testing 

then pick up different dataset and test on that (maybe on MIT dataset)

Read their paper in detail 

experiment with length of the samples 

is there 1s chopping up of the samples very good? or could a more intelligent method be to seperate by heartbeat 

check how the AF labels were made, on patient or per ECG

How to extract probabilty instead of classification 

Holter monitor
Challenge 2020 - CPSC Database - may have some Lead 1 over 10 secs
INCART Databchase - Holter but check the leads


Start thinking of my approach 


1) test on training dataset (sanity check)
2) test on alternative dataset (challenge 2020 subset with lead 1 only, small subset becuase need to check manually, chop up/normalise as done in Novel Neural Net approach) 


physionet 2020 cpsc dataset

holter recordings rarely have lead 1
