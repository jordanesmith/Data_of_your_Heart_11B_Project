PRESENTATION on 25th
can do practice one on 18th

potentially need to add band pass filter if the 2020 dataset is from ECG because it won't be filtered if thats the case

check the sample frequency

check that the scales of the test datasets are roughy the same, because there wasn;t any normalisation in the preprocessing of the training 2017 dataset, and may be completely different scale to 2020

start with testing on 'Normal' labels first to see how they go

starting point of producing a probability by using proportion of the 1 second sample that were classified as AF for example (call this 'confidence')

***0 get presentation ready and just add numeric results at the end
***1 check preprocessign for 2020 (normalisation, sampleing rate)
***2 get probability with above method
***3 test current model on 2020 and see how it perfomrs 

presentation:
problem, why its difficult, challenges involved
background litereature, who else is looking into it
hwo to measure the performance
objectives of the project
overview of methodology 
intiial results
plan going forward 


plan of experiments:
first one, try their model on the training dataset
second one, take training dataset and add noise and see how it performs
third, built tooling (already dsuch one part of it)
fourth, take one dataset from challenge 2020 which is most applicable, as lead 1
fifth, take MIT dataset because has normal and AF set, evaluate 2017 model on it (if its lead 1 but that is unlikely)

basically take any lead 1 data as a test dataset, start with only a few datapoints and check them before trying on all (starting on 'Normal' classified data before 'AF', then go to the more involved labels because 2020 has much more specific labelling)
take in mind the gain/ amplitude, sampling frequency, filtering <-- these might all make a difference
to help with this ^ maybe plot 2020 data on same plot as 2017 to check scales etc
