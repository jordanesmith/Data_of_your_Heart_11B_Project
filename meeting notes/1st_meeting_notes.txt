First meeting notes:


different types of irredgularities 
some caused by breathing 
clear p wave is definitely not AF
p wave less pronounced in 1 lead 
need to be careful with training on 1 lead then applying to 2 lead
AF burden 
symptomatic and asumptomatic AF

investigate other arhythmia and difference in AF signs on one lead or two lead
what is l lead?
read about the elctrcical sygnal from ECG
sharpen up objectives 
check stats on dataset with Peter
go through approaches on physionet challenge 2017

Questions for Peter:
1) Just a check on the numbers, so it was how many hundreds/ thousands of patients with ECG recordings? With 4 30 second samples per day for 3 weeks so 84 recordings per patient?
2) So the annotations/ labels were whether Patients is AF positive or negative? Which is then extrapolated for all samples per that patient. This means that some ECG samples will be labelled as 'AF positive' despite not showing the signs of AF.
3) What are the label options? I'm guessing its (AF positive/AF negative/poor quality), (normal/AF/other/low quality), (non-AF/AF/low quality), along with those specific unstructured comments that were made by Cardiologists on some samples.
4) How many instances of the cardiologists disagreeing on their labelling were there?
5) Is there any other dataset that can be used for testing or is the feasibility study dataset the only one we will have access to? This would help with testing of the model, as opposed to simply splitting the feasibility dataset into train/test split.
