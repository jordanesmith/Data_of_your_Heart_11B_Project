put in ectopoic beat dfeinition in presentation 

atrial and ventricular extopic beats are different, fiond differnce in definition and ECG shape

are they needed in the presentation 

learn the differenty codes for ECGs such as V1 or lead 1

12 lead ecg tupically last 10 seconds 

what does PVC or ventricular ectopic beat look like in lead 1?

explain the p wave being significant 

***describe/summarise the dataset in the slides, the challenge 2017 
***explain how they trained/tested the model (did i include noisy data?)
***explain/ decide how to divide dataset into train/test model [2017, 2020 (12 lead data therefore 10 seconds) several dataset,  MIT sinus rhythm/ arhythmia dataset ] <--- all data found on physionet


presentation:

Why started on 2017 data

identifying the other potential conditions and their issues associated

suggested approach

attempt to get some first feasibility results on 2017 data
