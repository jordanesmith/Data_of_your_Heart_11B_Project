*** talk to Yoav about the band pass filtering with the SAFER data

apply his method 

get to the stage that can get some stats out, and the quick gains for the application

**compare to zenicor algorithms by per person or per ecg by running algorithm on entire dataset

anything labelled Normal by Zenicor wasn't sent to cardiologist, therefore expecting all data that is  on hard drive to be difficult to read as it as ifentififed as not normlal

feas1 study is entirely labelled by cardiologist 

eventually come up with a good performance matrix, because otherwise no measure possible

Want the assesor to pay more attention on the performance than the algorithm development

check that Feas2 data looks like Feas1 and is same preprocessing
