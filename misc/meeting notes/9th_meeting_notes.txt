investigate the peaks detected on 2017 dataset using the current R algorithm

*** reproduce results on MIT not 2017 dataset

check the grid divisions as proportions seem very small

use their threshold in the paper 

normalise the number of RR intervals

apply to 2020 dataset as well with the holter dataset from that challenge

investigate whether the grid count proportion as a percentage of total RR intervals per sample can be scaled acrooss different legnths of scans

then say cut sampels in terms of 30 second sampels rather than no. RR intervals to mimick safer data

take smaller steps with introducing data in the method, start with smaller subsections of the dataset
