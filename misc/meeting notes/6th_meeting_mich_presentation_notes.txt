presentation notes:

problem is not 10 seconds rather than 30 seconds. For ahythmia detection they tak 30 second rhythm strip. Emphasis on 1 lead therefore cheap and screening is possible. 
Lower AF burden (usually asymptomatic) leads to increased likelihood they're missed in a single point ECG

image of different arhythmia 

explain why presence of p waves are more important than lack of presence 

move RR Intervals slide to help explain irregular irregular vs periodic irregular 

summarise the dataset page explaining that for future (most data is yet to be gathered) there will be screening for 3? weeks per person. Train 
on the previous data which is 1,2 or 4 weeks. 

emphasise that cardiologist only has to see one with AF and job done
cariologist is expensive
for importance of the project, explain how many people are yet to be screened and the help this will provide

emphasise,, on background literature slide, that the NNN approach was one of the winners of challenge 2017, is proven 

check whether biobank paper is on physionet 2017 or other challenge

maybe show ectopics to help explain difficulties with detecting AF
