*** sort out MITBIH dataset source (maybe look at metadata files)
Remove other, remove noisy, only include normal (and clean) or AF

see if cutting out smaller RR intervals which are cuased by noise leading to more R peaks detected

find out confusion matrdix, or sensitivity / specificity of 2017 with RR 

remove "other" from RR intervals method with 2017 dataset  	

ask Yoav for the 'cleanest' 2017 data

THink about why the threshold values calculated changes depending on the RR intervals per sample. Because SAFER is 30 seconds therefore less RR intervals in each section 

What is the minimum number of RR intervals in SAFER samples 

*** end up with much less, and much cleaner, data
