   abstract = {When the upper chambers of the heart (atria) do not pump efficiently, as in atrial fibrillation, there's a risk of blood clots forming.

These blood clots may move into the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) and get pumped into the blood supply to the lungs or the general blood circulation.

Clots in the general circulation can block arteries in the brain, causing a stroke.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of a stroke by around 5 times.

But the risk depends on a number of factors, including your age and whether you have high blood pressure (hypertension), heart failure, diabetes and a previous history of blood clots.

   abstract = {Detection of atrial fibrillation (AF) from electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings is one of the prevailing challenges in the field of cardiac computing. The task of the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology 2017 challenge is to distinguish the AF rhythms from non-AF rhythms using a short single lead ECG recording. In this study, we analyzed 62 time and frequency-domain, linear, and nonlinear features to discriminate four classes, viz., normal sinus rhythm, AF, noisy, or other rhythm. The feature space dimension was reduced to 37 using a Genetic Algorithm based feature selection. We trained a random forest classifier on the given 8,528 training dataset and obtained a ten-fold cross validation classification accuracy of 82.7%. On the test dataset, we obtained an F1-score of 0.91, 0.74, and 0.70 for NSR, AF, and other rhythms, respectively. Results suggest that with the proposed model it is possible to classify cardiac abnormalities from a single lead ECG even when the recordings are of short duration.},

These features include morphological and rhythm-related features that are used to build two classifiers: one that evaluates the record globally, using aggregated values for each feature; and another one that evaluates the record as a sequence, using a Recurrent Neural Network fed with the individual features for each detected heartbeat. The two classifiers are finally combined using the stacking technique, providing an answer by means of four target classes: Normal sinus rhythm (N), Atrial fibrillation (A), Other anomaly (O) and Noisy (∼). The approach has been validated against the 2017 Physionet/CinC Challenge dataset, obtaining a final score of 0.83 and ranking first in the competition.},

   abstract = {Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is characterized by chaotic electrical impulses in the atria, which leads to irregular heartbeats and can develop blood clots and stroke. Therefore, early detection of AF is crucial for increasing the success rate of the treatment. This study is focused on detection of AF rhythm using hand-held ECG monitoring devices, in addition to three other classes: normal or sinus rhythm, other rhythms, and too noisy to analyze. The pipeline of the proposed method consists of three major components: preprocessing and feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. In total, 491 hand-crafted features are extracted. Then, 150 features are selected in a feature ranking procedure. The selected features are from time, frequency, time-frequency domains, and phase space reconstruction of the ECG signals. In the final stage, a random forest classifier is used to classify the selected features into one of the four aforementioned ECG classes. Using the scoring mechanism provided by PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge 2017, the overall score (mean±std) of 81.9±2.6% is achieved over the training dataset in 10-fold cross-validation. The proposed algorithm tied for the first place in the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2017 with an overall score of 82.6% (rounded to 83%) on the unseen test dataset.},

   abstract = {Electrocardiograms (ECG) provide a non-invasive approach for clinical diagnosis in patients with cardiac problems, particularly atrial fibrillation (AF). Robust, automatic AF detection in clinics remains challenging. Deep learning has emerged as an effective tool for handling complex data analysis with minimal pre- and post-processing. A 16-layer 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was designed to classify the ECGs including AF. One of the key advances of the proposed CNN was that skip connections were employed to enhance the rate of information transfer throughout the network by connecting layers earlier in the network with layers later in the network. Skip connections led to a significant increase in the feature learning capabilities of the CNN as well as speeding up the training time. For comparisons, we also have implemented recurrent neural networks (RNN) and spectrogram learning. The CNN was trained on 8, 528 ECGs and tested on 3, 685 ECGs ranging from 9 to 60 seconds in length. The proposed 16-layer CNN outperformed RNNs and spectrogram learning. The training of the CNN took 2 hours on a Titan X Pascal GPU (NVidia) with 3840 cores. The testing accuracy for the CNN was 82% and the runtime was ∼0.01 seconds for each signal classification. Particularly, the proposed CNN identified normal rhythm, AF and other rhythms with an accuracy of 90%, 82% and 75% respectively. We have demonstrated a novel CNN with skip connections to perform efficient, automatic ECG signal classification that could potentially aid robust patient diagnosis in real time.},

Results also show that, the said methodology, when applied on a hidden test set maintained by the challenge organisers yields F1-score values of 0.92, 0.86 and 0.74 in classifying the same.},

   abstract = {Objective: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with an estimated prevalence of around 1.6% in the adult population. The analysis of the electrocardiogram (ECG) data acquired in the UK Biobank represents an opportunity to screen for AF in a large sub-population in the UK. The main objective of this paper is to assess ten machine-learning methods for automated detection of subjects with AF in the UK Biobank dataset. Approach: Six classical machine-learning methods based on support vector machines are proposed and compared with state-of-the-art techniques (including a deep-learning algorithm), and finally a combination of a classical machine-learning and deep learning approaches. Evaluation is carried out on a subset of the UK Biobank dataset, manually annotated by human experts. Main results: The combined classical machine-learning and deep learning method achieved an F1 score of 84.8% on the test subset, and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.83, which is similar to the inter-observer agreement of two human experts. Significance: The level of performance indicates that the automated detection of AF in patients whose data have been stored in a large database, such as the UK Biobank, is possible. Such automated identification of AF patients would enable further investigations aimed at identifying the different phenotypes associated with AF.},

   abstract = {Implantable loop recorders have been developed for long-term monitoring of cardiac arrhythmia, but their accuracy for atrial fibrillation (AF) detection is unsatisfactory. We sought to develop and evaluate a simple method for detecting AF using RR intervals. The new AF detection algorithm is based on a map that plots RR intervals versus change of RR intervals (RdR). The map is divided by a grid with 25-ms resolution in 2 axes and nonempty cells are counted to classify AF and non-AF episodes. We evaluated the performance of the method using 4 PhysioNet databases: MIT-BIH AF database, MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, MIT-BIH normal sinus rhythm (NSR) database, and NSR RR interval database (total 145 patients, 1,826 hours NSR, 96 hours AF, and 11 hours other rhythms). Each record is divided into consecutive windows containing 32, 64, or 128 RR intervals. AF detection is performed for each window and classification results are compared to annotations. A window is labeled true AF if >1/2 of cycles in the window are annotated as AF or non-AF otherwise. The RdR map shows signature patterns corresponding to various heart rhythms. Optimal nonempty cell cut-off threshold for AF detection was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, which yields excellent sensitivity and specificity for window sizes 32 (94.4% and 92.6%, respectively), 64 (95.8% and 94.3%), and 128 (95.9% and 95.4%). In conclusion, a single metric derived from the RdR map can achieve robust AF detection within as few as 32 heart beats. © 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
